# Summary

These guide provides instructions for setting up an environment for developing, debugging, and programming embedded systems firmware in Windows, both natively or via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2).

Anecdotally, WSL2 builds are faster.  Native builds in Windows can be sped up somewhat by making sure that Windows Defender or other antivirus is not actively scanning.
